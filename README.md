# Advents of Code

This repository facilitates that people can work on the puzzles from the public available https://adventofcode.com.

This repository and the code within has no direct integration to Advent of Code, but has a framework solution to easy place a dataset and get it pushed into your solution code. Also UnitTests are available to ease process around the puzzles solving, so you can focus on the most fun part - to solve the challenges.

I cannot take any credit for being part of Advent Of Code, it is the good work of [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) and his team.

Prerequisites:
 - C# knowledge, the solution is based on that
 - Visual Studio 2022 version 17.8.0 (Community edition is good enough)
 - .NET 8

## To solve the puzzles
1) Go to https://adventofcode.com
2) Login with Google account, Twitter or GitHub
3) Go to the year you like to work puzzles for - usually current year :-)
4) Read the first puzzle for Day 1, and use any code language to figure the output string
5) Submit your answer - and Part 2 puzzle will open.
6) Every day in December a new puzzle will open - Go GAME!
